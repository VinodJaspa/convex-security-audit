# Secure Convex + Next.js Enterprise Architecture

This repository demonstrates a hardened implementation of the Convex backend designed for scalability and security.

### Key Technical Implementations:
- **Strict Schema Validation:** Centralized data modeling in `convex/schema.ts` to ensure type-safety and prevent data corruption.
- **Middleware Security:** Integrated Auth patterns to protect server-side actions.
- **Production-Ready CI/CD:** Prepared for GitHub Actions to automate linting and type-checking before deployment.
